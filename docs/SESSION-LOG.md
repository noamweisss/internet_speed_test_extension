# Session log

Hand-off notes between agent sessions, newest first. The SessionStart hook prints the top entry; the Stop hook
refuses to end a session that changed the repo without a new entry. Keep entries factual: done, verified, not
verified, blocked, next.

## Session 2 — 2026-09-24 — branch `feat/install-without-visual-studio`

**Done**
- Harness branch `claude/determined-curie-7om0u6` renamed to `feat/install-without-visual-studio` (AGENTS.md §4).
  The generated remote branch still exists (same commit as `main`); not deleted, G6 blocks branch deletion.
- Plan item 2.1: CI builds an unsigned, self-contained MSIX, checks its contents, runs
  `install/Install-SpeedTestExtension.ps1` on the runner (install, verify, uninstall), and uploads the package
  with the script as artifact `internet-speed-test-extension-x64`. `docs/INSTALL.md`, ADR-0008.
- `install/` is safety-sensitive: added to R13 (`scripts/safety-impact.sh`), SAFETY-CONTRACT §2, CodeRabbit guard
  paths; R4 now scans `.ps1`.

- Real bug found by the first package build: MSIX rejects underscores in `Identity Name` (C00CE169), so no
  package could ever have been built, not even by Visual Studio. Identity is now `InternetSpeedTestExtension`
  (ADR-0009); project, assembly, exe name, and CLSID unchanged.

**Owner facts**
- Windows 11 Pro: Windows Sandbox is available, so INSTALL.md path A (Sandbox) applies.
- The laptop runs a Windows Insider build (26300.9539, 26H2), 31 GB RAM.
- Sandbox failed twice (0x80370106). A local Claude session on the laptop found the cause: the Windows inside
  Sandbox (which is the host's Insider build) blue-screened, bugcheck 0x3B, same code address both times, while
  the PowerToys installer ran. Not memory. Not caused by the extension (it was never installed).
- Test VM instead (set up by the local session, scripts outside the repo in `C:\Users\Noam\SpeedTestVM`):
  Hyper-V `SpeedTest-Win11`, Windows 11 Pro 25H2 retail build 26200.8037, PowerToys 0.101.2652.0, Command
  Palette 0.12.12651.0, Developer Mode on, checkpoint `clean-powertoys-devmode`. Scripts copy files in, collect
  logs (event logs, PowerToys and package logs, crash dumps) to the laptop, and revert the checkpoint. The owner
  pastes `summary.txt` and `errors-and-warnings.txt` from a log folder back into the cloud session.

**Verified**
- `scripts/check.sh all` passes locally.
- CI run 36041156689 on commit 305f2cf: all jobs green. On the Windows runner the script installed the package,
  `Get-AppxPackage` found it, and `-Uninstall` removed it. Artifact `internet-speed-test-extension-x64`: 14 MB zip,
  two files (MSIX + script), expires 2026-12-23.

- First real run (2026-09-25, owner, test VM): the CI build installs with the script, the extension appears in
  Command Palette and opens. So the packaging, COM activation, and the trimmed Release build load. The VM had no
  internet, so no measurement ran yet.
- Offline runs (owner): some failed at once with "Could not reach the speed test server", others stayed on
  "Measuring latency" about 30 s (owner pressed Esc). Command Palette and the VM stayed responsive throughout.
  Cause of the wait: 5 s /meta + 30 s request timeout when packets are dropped. Fixed in 6a09d4c with a 5 s
  `ConnectTimeout`. A second, icon-less "Internet Speed Test" entry (the package's app, which only works as a COM
  server) did nothing; hidden with `AppListEntry="none"` in 6a09d4c. Both fixes not yet re-tested.
- Found by reading the code after the run: nothing cancels a run when the page closes (the SDK was not seen to
  offer a page-closed signal). Esc leaves the test running in the background, bounded by its timeouts and
  2 × 8 s transfers; reopening shows it. `docs/TESTING.md` step 4 expects the test to stop: owner decides which.
- Owner decisions: Esc keeps the test running (TESTING.md updated); meter lists Latency first (20d43a9, 2 tests,
  71 total). CI artifacts are now named `internet-speed-test-extension-x64-<short sha>` (first: `…-20d43a9`,
  run 36114691892, green). The owner's local session is adding a VM-side script that downloads the newest green
  artifact with `gh` (read-only fine-grained token) and installs it; that script lives outside the repo.
  Its log is on branch `docs/local-vm-setup-log` (`docs/VM-SETUP-LOCAL-SESSION-LOG.md`, not merged).
- First online run (owner, VM with internet, build 20d43a9): the meter froze on "Measuring latency"; reopening
  showed partial results. Cause, confirmed in PowerToys source (`ContentPageViewModel.Model_ItemsChanged` calls
  `GetContent()` synchronously): `MeterPage` raised ItemsChanged on every redraw, including inside `GetContent`,
  so each redraw triggered another, looping and blocking the measurement thread. Fixed in 5fbf29a: the page only
  sets `MarkdownContent.Body` (the host listens to its PropChanged). Rule added to CONVENTIONS. Not yet re-tested.
- Session-1 unknowns answered from the source: Body updates re-render live (PropChanged is handled);
  RaiseItemsChanged on a ContentPage makes the host re-call GetContent (so never from inside it).

**Pull request**
- [noamweisss/internet_speed_test_extension#7](https://github.com/noamweisss/internet_speed_test_extension/pull/7)
  opened 2026-09-25 at the owner's request. CI green on 0971b9a (safety-impact check passed on its first real run).
- Codex: 1 finding (missing `Guard-Change:` trailers). Did not reproduce, all four guard commits carry it; answered
  with evidence and resolved.
- CodeRabbit: 3 findings on the install script, all valid, fixed in 6bd7c2e. The script now checks the new
  package's file count, unpacked size and package name before removing the installed one. INSTALL.md documents
  0x80073D02 (package in use). Replied on each thread. Whether an update over a running extension hits
  0x80073D02 is not yet tested. CodeRabbit follow-up (partial extraction after removal) fixed in 39bd686: the
  script extracts into `InternetSpeedTestExtension.new`, checks it, and only then replaces the old install.
- Real package size (CI log): 73 files, 32.5 MB unpacked; the script's limits are 5000 files and 500 MB.
- Artifacts are uploaded only by push runs: pull_request runs build a merge commit that exists on no branch.

**Second online run (owner, VM, 2026-09-28, build from this branch)**
- Works end to end: the meter updates live and finishes ("Complete at 12:02"), the details view lists every value.
  Two runs: 160.2 / 34.5 Mbps, latency 28.5 ms, jitter 78.9 ms; 162.7 / 38.4 Mbps, latency 71.6 ms, jitter 35.8 ms.
- Logs (`C:\Users\Noam\SpeedTestVM\Logs\2026-09-28_12-04-16`, read in this session): package
  `InternetSpeedTestExtension` 0.0.1.0, Status Ok, development mode. No crash dumps, no WER reports, no extension
  errors. Event log noise only (activation, DNS, time sync, one DCOM timeout); one harmless AppxPackaging warning
  (the build namespace `http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/appx/2015/build` in the generated manifest is ignored).
- Four bugs found, all in `SpeedTest.Core`, all older than PR #7, none fixed yet (confirmed with curl from the cloud
  session on 2026-09-28):
  1. ISP always "—": `GET /meta` answers `403 {}` unless the request carries `Referer: https://speed.cloudflare.com/`
     (with it: 200 and full JSON). The code falls back to response headers silently, and headers carry no ISP.
  2. Even with the Referer, parsing would fail: real `/meta` has `"colo": {"iata": "IAD", "lat": ..., "city": ...}`
     (an object), not a string. `CloudflareMeta.Colo` is `string?`, so deserialization throws and the result is
     empty. `FakeCloudflareHandler.MetaJson` has `"colo":"TLV"`: the fake encoded the wrong belief (as in session 1).
  3. Location "H%CC%B1olon, IL": the fallback `city` header is percent-encoded UTF-8 ("H̱olon"). Header values
     need `Uri.UnescapeDataString` (bounded, invalid escapes kept as-is).
  4. Jitter larger than latency: with `/meta` failing, the first latency probe also opens the connection
     (DNS + TCP + TLS), one slow sample that inflates jitter (median latency resists it). Fix: one unmeasured
     warm-up probe before the samples, so the result does not depend on `/meta` warming the connection.

**Not verified**
- `Ctrl+L`, `Ctrl+R`, copying a row, the default-view setting, and an update over a running extension
  (0x80073D02 or not): not reported in the second run.
- Whether a folder-registered package keeps loading after Developer Mode is switched off (INSTALL.md says it may not).
- Whether PowerToys Command Palette runs inside Windows Sandbox on a retail Windows build (untested; the
  owner's host is an Insider build, where Sandbox crashes).

**Next** (PR #7: CI green, all threads resolved, CodeRabbit approved on 8447721; the owner merges it)
Next session, on a new branch from `main` (plan items 2.5, 2.6, then 2.4):
- 2.5: fix the four bugs above in `SpeedTest.Core`, test-first with the real `/meta` shape (copy the JSON above
  into `FakeCloudflareHandler`, add a test that `/meta` without the Referer gets 403 and still yields header data,
  a test for percent-encoded header values, and one for the warm-up probe). The Referer is a constant string on the
  same host: no new host, no user data (SAFETY-CONTRACT §3 answers stay "No").
- 2.6: merge the Dependabot PRs #2 (setup-dotnet 6.0.0), #3 (checkout 7.0.1), #4 (Test.Sdk 18), #6 (xunit runner
  4). Their only red check is safety-impact (no "Safety impact" section). SHAs of #2 and #3 were verified against
  the release tags on 2026-09-25. Rebase order: #2 and #3 first (they remove the Node 20 deprecation warning).
- The owner re-tests in the VM: the ISP shows, the location reads normally, jitter is plausible; plus the checks
  under "Not verified" above. Then 2.4 (tag `v0.1.0`, release).
- CodeRabbit reviews only on an `@coderabbitai review` comment here (fewer than 10 stars), one per hour on the
  free plan: request it once per finished PR, not for docs-only pushes.

## Session 1 — 2026-09-24 — branch `feat/speedtest-core-and-ui`

**Done**
- Guard hooks (git + Claude Code) and `scripts/check.sh` with rules R1–R11, C1, P1–P3, G1–G8, W1–W2, S1.
- Documentation scaffolding, ADRs 0001–0006, roadmap in `docs/PLAN.md`.
- `src/SpeedTest.Core` (measurer, model, formatting, meter markdown) and 51 xUnit tests.
- Extension: `SpeedTestCommandsProvider`, `SettingsManager`, `SpeedTestSession`, `ViewCommands`, `MeterPage`,
  `DetailsPage`. Template types renamed per ADR-0005; `Program.cs` updated once (trailer `Protected-Change`).
- CI workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (rules, Core tests on Linux, extension build on Windows).
- Safety layer for a non-developer owner: `docs/SAFETY-CONTRACT.md`, `scripts/safety-impact.sh` (R13, runs on
  PRs), R12 capability check, `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`, `.github/dependabot.yml`, `.coderabbit.yaml`.

**Verified**
- Hook scripts self-tested with sample inputs (blocked and allowed cases). Claude hooks confirmed live in-session.
- Core tests pass locally on Linux (.NET 10.0.401). `scripts/check.sh` passes.
- Toolkit API signatures taken from the NuGet package (Microsoft.CommandPalette.Extensions 0.9.260303001) via
  reflection, not from memory; sample pages from microsoft/PowerToys read for usage patterns.

- CI run 1 on commit a02a46d: all three jobs green (rules, Core tests on Linux, extension build on Windows x64).

**Not verified**
- Nothing has run inside Command Palette. Unknowns to confirm in session 2: whether `MarkdownContent.Body`
  updates re-render live, whether `RaiseItemsChanged` on a `ContentPage` is needed/allowed, whether shortcut
  key chords fire on `ListItem.MoreCommands`, and whether `GetContent`/`GetItems` are only called on navigation
  (drives the "start if stale" behaviour in `SpeedTestSession`).
- The upload measurement counts bytes as they are handed to the socket, not as acknowledged; may read high on
  buffered links. Tuning item 3.3.

**Owner decisions this session**
- Option A (Cloudflare, ADR-0002). Repo is public. License: MIT plus authorship notice, "Noam" as the human.
- No auto-generated branch names; the harness branch `claude/elegant-hypatia-lfpr8p` was renamed and the
  remote copy deleted with the owner's explicit permission (rule P3, AGENTS.md §4).
- Owner has VS Code, not Visual Studio; session 2 must deliver an install path without Visual Studio.

**Environment notes**
- Cloud environment has .NET 10 SDK via setup script and network access to `speed.cloudflare.com`, NuGet, and
  Microsoft download hosts. Ookla hosts are not allowlisted (Option A chosen, ADR-0002).

**Review round 1**
- CodeRabbit (assertive profile) returned 17 findings on PR #1: 8 security, 4 stability/correctness, 5 docs and
  test quality. Every one was verified against the code and fixed in one commit; none were disputed. Notable:
  redirects were followed by default (fixed), `/meta` failures were fatal (now optional), non-HTTP exceptions
  could leave the UI stuck (now surface as Failed), server text reached markdown unescaped (now escaped).
- Observation for future sessions: the reviewer's "cf-meta-*" header claim conflicted with headers observed by
  curl earlier in the session (bare `city`/`colo`); the code now reads both. The tests previously mirrored the
  code's assumption, so they could not catch it: a reminder that fakes encode beliefs.

**Review round 2 (Codex, posted by the owner using docs/REVIEW-PROMPT.md)**
- 6 findings: 2 blockers (stalled `/meta` body not time-bounded because `HttpClient.Timeout` ends at the headers
  with `ResponseHeadersRead`; download responses not bounded by the requested bytes), 1 major (R10/R12 read the
  working tree in staged mode), 2 minor (Failed never retried on reopen; ownership check and publish not atomic),
  1 nit (`Task.Run` around the transfer loops, kept: it guards the synchronous-completion case the tests exercise
  and keeps the loops off the host's thread). Five fixed in one commit, 69 tests.
- The two reviewers found different things: CodeRabbit the redirect and escaping issues, Codex the timeout and
  byte bounds. Two independent models, same five questions, was worth it.

**Operating notes for reviewers and CI (learned in this session)**
- CodeRabbit does not review automatically on repositories with fewer than 10 stars: after every push, post
  `@coderabbitai review` as a PR comment. The free tier also rate-limits reviews (about one per half hour);
  a rate-limited trigger must be repeated later. Reply on each thread before pushing so it can verify the commit.
- GitHub's "automatic dependency submission" (enabled by the owner under Security) runs `dotnet restore` on
  Linux. The extension project sets `EnableWindowsTargeting` so that restore succeeds off Windows.

**Pull request**
- [noamweisss/internet_speed_test_extension#1](https://github.com/noamweisss/internet_speed_test_extension/pull/1),
  opened at the owner's request at the end of session 1 and **merged into main on 2026-09-24** after two
  independent reviews (CodeRabbit round 1: 17 findings; Codex rounds 2 and 2b: 7 findings) with every finding
  fixed or answered. The owner dismissed CodeRabbit's stale "changes requested" verdict and merged with a merge
  commit. The owner is adding a ruleset on `main` (pull request + status checks required).

**Session 1 final state**
- `main` = session-1 result. 69 Core tests. Nothing has yet run inside Command Palette on a real PC.
- Owner has not yet said which Windows edition they use; ask before writing `docs/INSTALL.md` (Sandbox needs Pro).

**Next**
- Session 2 in `docs/PLAN.md`, starting at item 2.1: CI artifact + install script without Visual Studio, then the
  owner runs the manual checklist. Rename the harness branch first (AGENTS.md §4).
- The safety-impact CI job has only been tested locally (`scripts/safety-impact.sh` with a fake PR body); its
  first real run is on the first PR. CodeQL ran on push; check the Security tab for findings.
